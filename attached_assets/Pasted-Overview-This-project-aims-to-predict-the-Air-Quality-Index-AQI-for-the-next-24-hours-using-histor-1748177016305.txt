Overview
This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for the next 24 hours using historical air pollution, weather, and traffic data. The model leverages supervised machine learning techniques to make accurate forecasts and support smart urban planning and public health decisions.

It is based on Case Study 4 from the AI & Green Skills curriculum, focusing on how AI can combat urban air pollution and improve sustainability.

Objectives
To understand the key factors affecting air quality.

To develop a machine learning model that can predict AQI with high accuracy.

To analyze the impact of pollution and weather patterns on urban environments.

To demonstrate how AI can support early-warning systems for public safety.

Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

pandas, numpy – Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

scikit-learn – Preprocessing and modeling

xgboost – Advanced regression modeling

Replit – Online coding environment (no installation needed)

Dataset
You can use:

Delhi Air Quality Dataset (Kaggle)

Contains data from 2015 to 2020, including:

PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO (Pollutants)

Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed (Weather)

Timestamp for time-series modeling

Workflow
Load and Clean the Dataset

Handle missing/null values

Convert date column to datetime format

Extract features like hour, day, and month

Feature Engineering

Select relevant features for prediction (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, Temp)

Normalize or scale features if needed

Model Training

Split data into training and test sets

Train an XGBoost Regressor model

Evaluate using RMSE or MAE

Prediction

Predict AQI for unseen data

Plot actual vs predicted AQI for comparison

Visualization

Show correlation heatmap

Line chart for time-series AQI changes

Actual vs Predicted AQI comparison

Future Enhancements
Deploy as a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction.

Integrate live API feeds for traffic and weather.

Add location-based AQI maps using Folium or Plotly.

How to Run on Replit
Create a new Python Replit: https://replit.com

Upload your dataset (air_quality.csv or similar)

Add the following in main.py:

Data loading

Preprocessing

Model training

Visualization

Run the file — Replit will display plots directly in the output tab.

Expected Output
RMSE/MAE of AQI prediction

Charts showing model performance

Insight into most influential features on air pollution

Real-Life Impact
This model mimics the real-world AI system used in Delhi to forecast AQI and issue public warnings. By enabling early responses to high pollution days, AI can help:

Reduce outdoor exposure

Improve city traffic management

Support sustainable urban planning
